Everyone tells you to learn Linux before DevOps, but no one tells you what specific parts of Linux to focus on. 

👉From my earlier experience, I know that Linux is an ocean with too many things to learn.

✅ Linux topics to learn before other DevOps tools:

🔺 Process Management: Check running processes, their CPU and memory utilization using commands like ps, top, htop, and kill. View process hierarchy with pstree to understand parent-child relationships

🔺Networking: Master commands to check network interfaces (ifconfig, ip), firewall configuration (iptables, ufw), used ports (netstat, ss), and general connectivity (ping, traceroute, dig)

🔺File Structure Manipulation: Get comfortable with file/directory creation, copying/moving data, navigating directory trees, and understanding absolute vs. relative paths (mkdir, cp, mv, cd, pwd)

🔺File Permissions & Ownership: Learn to manage who can read, write, or execute files using chmod, chown, and chgrp. Understand numeric and symbolic permission notation (755, u+x)

🔺File System Usage: Learn commands like df (disk free space), du (disk usage), and related tools to monitor storage

🔺Search & Filter: Practice finding files with various parameters (find), searching patterns in files (grep, sed), and filtering data outputs (cut, awk, sort)

🔺Package Management: Understand how to install/uninstall packages using package managers like apt, yum, or dnf

🔺System Configuration: Learn about system information commands, startup scripts, profile files (.bashrc, .profile), and how to create useful aliases

🔺System Monitoring: Master commands to check system load (uptime), CPU and memory usage (free, vmstat, sar), and swap utilization (swapon --show)

🔺Service Management: Get familiar with both systemctl commands (systemctl start/stop/restart/status) and legacy service commands for managing system services

🔺SSH Configuration: Learn to set up secure remote connections, configure SSH keys, and customize settings in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

🔺Basic Shell Scripting: Learn how to automate routine tasks with bash scripts, including variables, loops, conditionals, and functions

🔺System Information: Use commands like uname to get kernel information, architecture details, and other system specifics

Remember, you'll always pick up additional Linux skills while working in DevOps.
