# DevOps Engineer Interview Questions

Cloud Architecture & Compliance (Azure/AWS)
1. How would you design an automated backup and restore mechanism for a core banking system hosted in Azure?
2. What is your approach to ensuring PCI-DSS and RBI compliance in infrastructure provisioning using Terraform?
3. How do you audit and enforce tagging policies for cost visibility across hundreds of cloud resources?
4. What are Azure Blueprints and how would you use them to enforce security baselines in a banking project?

#🔁 CI/CD Pipeline & Release Governance
1. Describe a strategy to implement multi-approval gated deployments in Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions.
2. How do you perform policy-as-code validation before every infrastructure deployment?
3. How would you isolate staging and production pipelines and secure access in a shared DevOps project?
4. What’s your rollback strategy for stateful applications deployed via Helm or Kustomize?

#🐳 Kubernetes (AKS/EKS) & Container Security
1. How do you secure inter-pod communication in AKS using network policies and service mesh (e.g., Istio)?
2. What steps would you take to ensure container images are free from known vulnerabilities before they reach production?
3. How do you scale AKS workloads based on message queue depth or financial transaction volume?
4. Explain how you’d implement runtime security for containers using tools like Falco or eBPF.

#🔐 Secrets Management & IAM

3. Have you enforced multi-factor access for infrastructure automation tools (e.g., Terraform Cloud, GitHub runners)?

#📈 Monitoring, Logging & SRE Practices
1. How do you set up SLOs for banking APIs and trigger alerts when they breach thresholds?
2. Which tools do you use for tracing and diagnosing latency in distributed systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)?
3. How do you differentiate false positives from real incidents in cloud monitoring setups?
