# 🐳 Kubernetes (AKS/EKS) & Container Security
1. How do you secure inter-pod communication in AKS using network policies and service mesh (e.g., Istio)?
2. What steps would you take to ensure container images are free from known vulnerabilities before they reach production?
3. How do you scale AKS workloads based on message queue depth or financial transaction volume?
4. Explain how you’d implement runtime security for containers using tools like Falco or eBPF.
5. Explain your production-grade Kubernetes architecture.
6. How do you troubleshoot CrashLoopBackOff and ImagePullBackOff?
7. What happens when readiness/liveness probes fail?
8. How do you implement autoscaling (HPA/VPA/Cluster Autoscaler)?
9. How do you manage secrets securely in Kubernetes (Vault / Sealed Secrets)?
10. Pods are getting evicted when traffic increases. How do you identify and resolve the eviction reason?
11. New pods stay in “Pending” but the cluster autoscaler is not creating new nodes. What could be wrong?
12. A pod is running but refuses TCP connections – how do you debug?
13. How do you handle GPU scheduling in EKS (or GKE)?
14. How do you implement secure multi-tenant namespaces in Kubernetes?
15. What are the scale limits of kube-proxy iptables, and how do you fix them?
16. How do you detect and resolve half-open TCP connections from a service mesh?
17. What is the use of Helm in Kubernetes?
18. Explain how Kubernetes schedules a pod from request → running state.
19. What are Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets?
20. What are readiness vs liveness probes and why are they important?
21. How do you implement secrets securely in Kubernetes?
22. How would you troubleshoot CrashLoopBackOff or ImagePullBackOff?
23. Pod in CrashLoopBackOff — how do you debug?
24. Deployment vs StatefulSet vs DaemonSet — real use cases?
25. How do you expose a service externally?
26. How do ConfigMaps and Secrets work?
27. RollingUpdate vs Recreate strategy — when to use which?
