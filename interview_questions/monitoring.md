#📈 Monitoring, Logging & SRE Practices
1. How do you set up SLOs for banking APIs and trigger alerts when they breach thresholds?
2. Which tools do you use for tracing and diagnosing latency in distributed systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger)?
3. How do you differentiate false positives from real incidents in cloud monitoring setups?
4. How do you define SLIs/SLOs and prevent production incidents?
5. Grafana shows latency spikes but CPU/RAM remain normal. How do you isolate the root cause?
6. The team receives too many alerts per day. How do you check alerting to reduce noise?
7.  What are the main components of the ELK Stack?
8.
